//Abstract Class:
//1. We will have the methods but not the logic of it
//2. We cannot create an object of the class but we can use this class as part of the inheritnace
//3. It is a mix of concrete and abstract methods
//4. Abstractions varies from 0% to 100%
//5. Abstract keyword is used to recognize the abstract class and abstract methods
//6. Since abstract classes can be accessed by inheritance, we can implment or write the logic in the particular sub classes
